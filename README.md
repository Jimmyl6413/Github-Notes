## Git
 Git is the actual version control software. It helps manage and keep track of your entire history of work. It allows more than 2 people to work on the same thing without any problems. Git can help revert or change a single line without having to delete all the other ones. Git is a system that allows further collaboration. (Git is simply a version control software)

## Github
Github is like a server/hub for git where we can do all the git stuff(get it Git-HUB, a hub for Git). It helps run git like behind the scenes. Git hub is like a social network that everyone can use and do git things. In github we are able to see the history of changes in the repo files when we click history next to the pencil icon. We can do projects etc on github with version control on them.

## Repo
A repo is like a big folder or project where we can make multiple files and do multiple things in the repo.

## Commit
Where we make changes and want to commit to those changes and save. If commit is not done then what ever changes we do to a file in repo or anything won't save.
